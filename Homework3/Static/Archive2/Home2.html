    <p I make handcrafted natural soaps. My bathes are fresh, my ingredients are of the finest quality. My soaps are vegetable based, utilizing food grade olive oil, organic coconut oil, sunflower oil, shea butter, and small portion of organically harvested palm oil. All of my oils are highly unsaponified, glycerin rich, and highly moisturizing to all skin types. They lather well and sooth your skin.
       I use organic herbs, spices, grains, clays, minerals, sea plants. No synthetic coloring agents, dyes, preservatives, fixatives, germicides, or extra fillers. Scents are made primarily with pure botanical essential oils. Some contain the highest quality fragrance oils.
       I have a soap obsession! My addiction to cleanliness, freshness, and smells attracted me to what I do today. I grew up in Macedonia. My family grew a lot of vegetables. I was out in nature all day long collecting herbs with my grandmother. We produced, made, and created out own food. I spent a lot of time in the village where no grocery store existed so my grandmother had to make her own bread. And, not just that she also made soap. Her soap never used to dry my skin. When I came to the U.S. my body changed, my skin was dry. I was suffering. I bought and tested every soap I found on the market. And I only found one that didn’t dry my skin. That soap was handmade. Unfortunately, it lathered within two weeks and I could no longer used. So, I started researching… And here I am. Still obsessed with soaps. I found a way to connect nature, food, plants, and herbs and art together. I make soaps. And, I love what I do.
